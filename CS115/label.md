I have been told that my labeling with directories creates confusion.
Therefore, I want to add note which explains the label names briefly.

lab-19 -> The lab problems which has been asked in 2019 CS115 lab hours.

lab-20 -> These are the lab problems which has been asked in 2020.

lab -> This directory contains 2021 CS115 lab quesitons which is the lab questions directly asked to me. -I took CS115 2021 Fall-

Note that lab-19 and lab-20 are not complete since I couldn't find all of the quesitons.

I hope this makes label names a little bit more clear
(Ulas Dilek mentioned me about this issue so special thanks to him.)
