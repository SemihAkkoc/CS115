Well I went and lost her
To the great imposter
I stood and watched her fall
Couldn't help her at all
Poetry so sweet has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but
He has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
Don't she know he's on stage
It's not real it's just play
And he's playing the part
That is soon to break her heart
Oh can't she see tomorrow's misery
Soon she'll learn her fate
But it will be too late
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
Poetry so sweet has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but
He has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
All they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
All they know the great imposter
